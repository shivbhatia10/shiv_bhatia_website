      hi! I'm Shiv, I'm a programmer based in London. I'm interested in deep learning, specifically mechanistic
      interpretability, and I'm currently exploring projects in this space. when I'm not coding or doing maths, I like
      hiking and making music.

      # these are some of the things I've made:
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/shivbhatia10/wrist">[wrist]</a> - a fast, shell-agnostic terminal history application
      for
      MacOS written in Rust.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/shivbhatia10/torch_sparse_autoencoder">[torch_sparse_autoencoder]</a> - a minimal
      Pytorch library for handling sparse autoencoders for language/ing a simple API.vision models. designed to work for
      a wide range
      of model architectures while still providing a simple API.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/shivbhatia10/torch_sparse_autoencoder">[torch_sparse_autoencoder]</a> - a minimal
      Pytorch library for handling sparse autoencoders for language/vision models. designed to work for a wide range
      of model architectures while still providing a simple API.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/shivbhatia10/deto_x">[deto_x]</a> - a Chrome extension that lets you filter out
      tweets
      with a custom prompt and LLMs.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/shivbhatia10/IRSpectraToFunctionalGroupsCNN">[IR spectra CNN classifier]</a> -
      scraped
      a bunch of IR spectra data for organic compounds and trained a convolutional neural network to detect functional
      groups. the final model achieved an F1 score better than an average chemistry undergrad at Imperial.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/shivbhatia10/CellularSheafGenerator">[random cellular sheaf generator]</a> - often in
      computational algebraic topology, it's useful to be able to randomly generate simplicial complexes of arbitrary
      dimension in a usable format for experiments. working with a researcher at Imperial I wrote a small library for
      this purpose, specifically tailored to persistent homology experiments for topological data analysis.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/shivbhatia10/csvtui">[csvtui]</a> - a small Rust app that lets you view and edit csv
      files from the terminal with Vim-like keybindings.</p>
    <p><a href="https://terencehernandez.com/files/WACC/WACCLangSpec.pdf">[WACC]</a> - wrote a compiler written in Scala
      with <a href="https://github.com/j-mie6/parsley">parsley</a> for a
      variant on the While family of languages.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mjw03/OSLab/pintos.pdf">[Pintos]</a> - extended an x86 operating system with
      threads and user programs.</p>

      # these are some of the things I've worked on (the date is when I finished it):
    </p>
    <p><span class="date">[jan 2025]</span> - organised a <a
        href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7287150457280450561">hackathon</a>
      focused on interpretability in AI as part of <a href="ilikethefuture.com">SoTA</a>, a non-profit I co-founded with
      the aim of promoting techno-optimism in the UK.</p>
    <p><span class="date">[sept 2024]</span> - came back for a second internship at Palantir, where I developed a
      version control system for AIP products.</p>
    <p><span class="date">[june 2024]</span> - graduated with a first class MEng from Imperial College London where
      I studied maths and CS, mostly geometry, quantum physics, and deep learning.</p>
    <p><span class="date">[oct 2023]</span> - spent a summer as a software engineering intern at Palantir, where I
      worked on automations for ontology entities.</p>
    <p><span class="date">[oct 2023]</span> - led computer vision on the only UK team to compete in the world finals
      of
      the European Rover Challenge 2023. we built a Mars rover prototype with a 360 degree camera on its head that was
      capable of simultaneous localisation and mapping on an uneven terrain. ranked 1st on one of the major challenges
      and 11th out of 25 global teams in the final. <a
        href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/248356/student-built-mars-rover-international-competition/">media
        coverage</a></p>
    <p><span class="date">[june 2023]</span> - built RCoin, a real time auditable stablecoin pegged to the South
      African Rand, along with my flatmates. we built a complete app and working payment platform which was designed
      to replace expensive and monopolistic payment solutions available in Eswatini. got to consult directly with the
      finance minister on the design of the platform. we were the headline presentation at the Brevan Howard crypto
      showcase 2023.</p>
    <p><span class="date">[oct 2022]</span> - finished an internship at Microsoft, where I worked on adding video
      conferencing to a unified communications app.</p>
